// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. 
// Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.
// Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”
var firstName = 'Alan';
var secondName = 'Nathan';
console.log('The name ' + secondName + ' is longer than ' + firstName + ' by 2 ')
